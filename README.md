Have you enjoyed working from home recently, but now the boss wants you back in the office?  Keep the good times rolling with a WFH Bot that goes to the office for you!

## How It Works

The ultra-realistic WFH Bot is strategically positioned at your desk in your workplace so that face-to-face interaction can be restored, and bosses everywhere may rejoice.  Meanwhile, you continue to work from home, communicating through WFH Bot.

WFH Bot transmits both audio and video that it "hears" and "sees" over the Internet to your home office.  You can watch this stream from your home office, and when needed, you can talk through your computer, and WFH Bot will speak.

To make this work, WFH Bot is equipped with a Rapberry Pi 4, a webcam, a microphone, and a speaker.  The robot runs [this script](https://github.com/nickbild/wfh_robot/blob/main/wfh_robot.py), and the client runs [this one](https://github.com/nickbild/wfh_robot/blob/main/wfh_client.py).
